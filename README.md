## Hi there 👋
I'm Beatriz, but you may call me Bia.

### 👩‍💻 From Law to Code

I made the jump from law to software development and now work as a Software Developer Consultant at Thoughtworks, while continuing my learning journey at [42 São Paulo](https://www.42network.org/). 

### 🌱 Learning and Growing

I'm fluent in C and C++, but I also explore Node.js, TypeScript, Python, and sometimes (why not?) Java. 

I enjoy diving into different technologies and seeing where they take me.


### 🎯 Side Venture

As a side venture, I'm creating informative documents about 42 school projects.
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and making learning more accessible. By documenting my experiences and insights, I aim to help others navigate and excel in their coding endeavors.
